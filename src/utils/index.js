    I&apos;m a programmer and a learner. I was that kid who was ridiculed for
    asking questions. Years down the lane, I aspire to architect solutions.
    I&apos;m obsessed with coding, but I believe in thinking and planning before
    writing the code. I go mad when code isn&apos;t aligned. I like keeping the
    code DRY. The amount of code I punch in is directly proportional to the tea
    I consume. I cannot survive without stackoverflow.
  </p>,
  <p key="info-2">
    While I&apos;m not coding or doing stuff related to tech, you can find me
    reviewing a book {socialLinks.goodreads} or in a library. Or spending time
    with my cat, Anjali. She&apos;s a{' '}
    {moment().diff('2012-10-02', 'years', false)} year old white cat with
    beautiful yellow eyes.

    If you wish to connect with me, drop me an {socialLinks.email} - I&apos;m
    quick when it comes to responding to emails. Or leave a message for me on{' '}
    {socialLinks.facebook}. I&apos;m rare species of millennial that
    doesn&apos;t like using the tiny QWERTY touch-pad in my smart-phone, but I
    will get back.
